# Best-known solutions

Here you can find the best-known solutions (BKS) for the PDPTW instances. Below, the solutions are grouped according to the instance size (number of locations). There are 12 sizes: 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, and 5000 locations. Each group has exactly 25 instances.

For each solution, there is a detailed solution file available. In the following tables, it is presented the name of the instance, the number of vehicles and cost in the current BKS solution, a reference that found the solution, and the date it was submitted.

 Instance | Vehicles | Cost | Reference | Date
 :------: | -------: | ---: | :-------: | ---:
 bar-n100-1 | xx | yyyy | SB | 30-jan-19

## File structure

All instance files are structured in a common way. It follows the default format of SINTEF website for the PDPTW instances maintained by them. Below you can find a simple description, although one can inspect the solution files to see the strucutre as well.
