# Solution Validator

In this folder you find the validator used to verify the solutions for the new instances. It is possible to validate any solution with the Python (2.7) script. There is an auxiliar script that receives a folder with (many) solution files and runs through them all validating them.

There is also an script to generate the best-known solution tables presented in the *solutions/* folder. The same script also updates the current best-known solutions accordingly.
