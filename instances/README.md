# Instance files

The 300 instance files are too large to be stored in this git repository, unfortunately. Hence, I keep in this README file reference links that one may use to download the files for each instance size. 

## Download

Below you find the list of links to download each group of instance according to their total number of locations. There are 12 sizes: 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, and 5000 locations. Each group contains exactly 25 instances distributed in four cities (Barcelona, Berlin, New York, and Porto Alegre) with a wide range of configurations.

## File description

Each compressed (.zip) file contains one group of instances and a descriptive README file explaining how the instances should be read, and the information provided in each section of the file. The same description is presented here in the file [how_to_read.txt](https://github.com/cssartori/pdptw-instances/blob/master/instances/how_to_read.txt)

## Configurations of the instances

There is a text file [configurations.txt](https://github.com/cssartori/pdptw-instances/blob/master/instances/configurations.txt) in this folder, which contains the characteristics for each one of the 300 instances. The configurations include the distribution of locations used for each instance, the city it was generated in, number of clusters and their density (if appropriate), time window width, scheduling horizon, service durations, vehicle capacities, and position of the depot.

For more information on how the instances were generated, one is referred to my Master's thesis (link) and to the repository of the [instance generator](https://github.com/cssartori/ovig/)
