# Instance files

The 300 instance files are too large to be stored in this git repository, unfortunately. Hence, I keep in this README file reference links that one may use to download the files for each instance size. In this way, I am able to change the external location of the instances keeping this repository as a fixed link to them.

## Download

Below you find the list of links to download each one of the instance groups per total number of locations (the so-called size of the instance). There are 12 sizes: 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 5000. Each group contains exactly 25 instances distributed in four cities (Barcelona, Berlin, New York, and Porto Alegre) with a wide range of configurations.

## File description

Each compressed file containing one group of instances is accompained by a descriptive README file explaining how the instances should be read, and the information provided in each section of the file.

The same description is presented here. TODO: add description

## Characteristics of individual instances

There is a PDF file, and a text file (links) that are available in this folder, which contain the characteristics for each one of the 300 instances. In these files one can find the distribution of locations used for each instance, the city it was generated in, number of clusters and their density (when appropriate), time window width, scheduling horizon, service durations, vehicle capacities, and position of the depot.

For more information on how the instances were generated, one is referred to my Master's thesis (link) and to the repository of the instance generator (link).
