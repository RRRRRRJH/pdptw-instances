File structure of instance files (how to read).

The first 10 lines of each file contain general information about the
instance. These are:

NAME:  <unique instance identification>
LOCATION:  <city where it was generated>
COMMENT:  <a general reference>
TYPE:  <the type is always PDPTW>
SIZE:  <number of nodes including the depot>
DISTRIBUTION:  <the type of distribution*>
DEPOT:  <type of depot location: either 'central' or 'random'>
ROUTE-TIME:  <time horizon>
TIME-WINDOW:  <time window width>
CAPACITY:  <maximum vehicle capacity>

Then, a line containing the word NODES is followed by SIZE lines
containing the complete information of each location (node) in the
instance file. For each line, there are 9 fields separated by a
single white space character as below:

<id> <lat> <long> <dem> <etw> <ltw> <dur> <p> <d>

<id>:   is the unique node identifier ( node 0 is the unique depot )
<lat>:  latitude of this location
<lon>:  longitude of this location
<dem>:  the demand of this node ( dem > 0 for pickup, dem < 0 for delivery )
<etw>:  earliest possible time to start service (Time Window)
<ltw>:  latest possible time to start service (Time Window)
<dur>:  the service duration at this location
<p>:    the pickup pair if <id> is a delivery, and 0 otherwise
<d>:    the delivery pair if <id> is a pickup, and 0 otherwise


The <p> and <d> are for completeness reasons only. In all instances,
for a pickup location <id> its delivery is given by (<id>+((SIZE-1)/2)).
For a delivery location <id>, its pickup is given by (<id>-((SIZE-1)/2)).


After all NODES, there is a line containing the word EDGES followed by SIZE
lines, each one with SIZE integer values separated by a single white space
character. These integers represent the travel times between each pair of
locations in the instance, measured in minutes and computed throughout the
OSRM tool.

All instances end with a line containing the word EO.


NOTE-1: For cluster and cluster-random distributions (x / y) indicate
that x seeds were chosen to create clusters and the density used
in the selection of locations was y.

NOTE-2: There are only two float values in an instance: <lat> and <lon>.
All other values are integers.
(except for the cluster density when applicable)

NOTE-3: The only information that is stricly necessary to solve an instance
is included in the following fields: CAPACITY, NODES, EDGES. All the remaining
values are either auxiliary (e.g., SIZE) or simply additional information about
the instance.
